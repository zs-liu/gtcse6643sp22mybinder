At each step, we apply QR to a unitary matrix $U$, therefore:

$$U^{(k)}=QR\Rightarrow Q=U, R=I\Rightarrow U^{(k+1)}=RQ=Q=U^{(k)}$$

the matrix will not change after one step, i.e., it will not converge.

According to Theorem 28.4, $A^{(k)}$ converges linearly with constant $\max_k|\lambda_{k+1}|/|\lambda_k|$. For a unitary matrix, $|\lambda_{k+1}|/|\lambda_k|=1/1=1$. Therefore, it will not converge.
